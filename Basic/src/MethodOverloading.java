/* Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument lists are different.
It is similar to constructor overloading in Java, that allows a class to have more than one constructor having different argument lists.
If we overload the method, it is known as Method Overloading.
In other words, you can have more than one method with the same name in one class, if their argument lists are different.
Method Overloading is also known as Compile Time Polymorphism.*/

/*Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.
  With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

Inheritance is a way to reuse the code. We can add more features to a class without modifying it.

The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class).
The class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).

The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.

The subclass can use the superclass methods directly, without any extra work.*/

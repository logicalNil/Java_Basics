a)You are working on a project that requires storing information about a constant value that never changes. Which keyword would you use to declare a variable for this value and why?

b) Suppose you are creating a class to represent a set of related objects, and you want to ensure that all objects of this class share the same value for a particular variable. Which keyword would you use to declare this variable and why?

c) You are working on a project that requires creating multiple subclasses of a parent class, each with its own implementation of a particular method. Which keyword would you use to declare this method in the parent class and why?

d) Suppose you are working on a project that requires creating a class to represent an object with multiple properties that are not known at the time of instantiation. Which keyword would you use to declare the variables for these properties and why?


# Answer

a) The keyword to declare a variable for a constant value that never changes is `final`. This keyword ensures that the variable can only be assigned once and cannot be reassigned, making it ideal for storing values that should not be modified throughout the program's execution.

b) The keyword to declare a variable that all objects of a class share the same value is `static`. By declaring a variable as static, it is associated with the class rather than individual instances of the class. This means that any changes made to the variable will be reflected across all instances of the class.

c) The keyword to declare a method in the parent class that can be overridden by subclasses is `abstract`. An abstract method is declared without implementation, and its implementation is provided by its subclasses. This allows for the same method to have different behavior depending on the class that calls it.

d) The keyword to declare variables for properties that are not known at the time of instantiation is `private`. By declaring the variables as private, they can only be accessed through getter and setter methods, allowing for controlled access to the properties while still ensuring that they cannot be modified outside of the class.
